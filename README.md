Comonadic Matter Meets Monadic Anti-Matter: An Adjoint Model of Dualized Simple Type Theory
------------------------------------------------------------------

Bi-intuitionistic logic is a conservative extension of intuitionistic
logic with perfect duality; every logical operator of the logic has a
corresponding dual operator also in the logic.  This symmetry suggests
that bi-intuitionistic logic may lead to a foundational theory of
induction and co-induction.  Dualized Simple Type Theory was proposed
by Eades et al. as a bi-intuitionistic type theory that could be used
to study the relationship between induction and coinduction.  It is
the purpose of this paper to complete this line of inquiry by giving a
categorical model of Dualized Simple Type Theory using a combination
of two LNL models of Benton, which give rise to a monadic/comonadic
relationship between intuitionistic logic and co-intuitionistic logic.
We then extend both Dualized Simple Type Theory and its corresponding
semantics with induction and co-induction.
